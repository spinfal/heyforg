This plugin is a modified version of [heygirl](https://github.com/replugged-org/heygirl), which was originally made for [powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org)

"[Forgd](https://github.com/LandenStephenss/forgd)" used to be a plugin that pretty much did the same thing, but it isn't available anymore.

Heygirl was originally part of the set of official [Powercord plugins](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord/tree/v2/src/Powercord/plugins) as `pc-heygirl`.
